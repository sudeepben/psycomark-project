Basically they're saying to go up to the counter and ask for a shake you didn't order in the first place. \n I wouldn't do this, but it's interesting, because while In-N-Out seems super organized and on-the-ball in all things, shakes are one exception. Every time I order a shake it seems like it falls through the cracks. They call my number, I go up to get my food, and then usually I have to say something like \"my shake?\" and they'll go get it.  \n It's not like shakes needs to be served piping hot or something. In fact, usually the shakes are too thick to drink right at first anyway, so it would be nice if they poured them at the same time as the rest of the order, giving them a little time to melt.  \n Again, this \"tip\" is illegal AND unethical, and no one wants to take advantage of our favorite fast food joint, so don't do it.

It's a fault line, where one part of the Earth enters the other. Most of the time, this happens smoothly, as if Barry White were playing in the background. But every once in a while, our douche of a planet likes to get rough and America rejects the incoming plate. This is called a full-margin rupture, and it's as devastating as it sounds. The last time that happened was in 1700, and the earthquake was so big that it caused a giant tsunami that destroyed a bunch of coastal Japan across the ocean.\nThe Pacific Northwest is all but due for one of these, and it couldn't be more terrifying. When the next one happens, at roughly around a 9.0 (re: very bad) on the Richter scale, cities like Vancouver, Seattle, and Portland are in for what's been described as the worst natural disaster in the history of North America.

One was so powerful that it caused the river to run backwards for a few hours. Another was felt all the way on the East Coast. The epicenter of the quakes was the town of New Madrid, which might as well have been renamed New New Madrid, because it took years to rebuild it. \n Today, the affected cities sit peacefully on the mighty Mississippi -- despite that pesky 40 percent chance that a New-Madrid-level quake could hit in the next few decades. \n \n Earth is due for an \u201cextinction-level\u201d event from the sky \n \n ..and even if we see it coming, we won\u2019t be able to do anything about it, a NASA scientist said Monday. \n Speaking at a meeting in San Francisco, Dr. Joseph Nuth of NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center said large asteroids and comets, the type that could wipe out civilization, are extremely rare, but tend to hit \u201c50 to 60 million years apart.\u201d Given that a comet wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, one could argue that we\u2019re slightly past \u201cdue.\u201d \n \u201cThe biggest problem, basically, is there\u2019s not a hell of a lot we can do about it at the moment,\u201d he added. \n \n We are overdue for a massive Tsunami/Earth quake  to strike the US \n \n A natural disaster of titanic proportions is overdue to strike the U.S., physicist Michio Kaku warns. \n Seismologists predict it will be the worst natural disaster in North American history, and the federal government estimates it could contribute to 13,000 deaths and 27,000 injuries. \n \"It's not a question of if, it's a question of when,\" the City University of New York physics professor said Thursday on \"CBS This Morning.\" \n \n New York, which is actually riddled with faults, has a long history of earthquakes: On average, the region has witnessed a moderate quake (about a 5.0 on the Richter scale) every hundred years.
