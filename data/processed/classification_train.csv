From 2012 to 2020, investors have bought almost $640 billion of equities issued by oil, gas and coal producers, fossil fuel- dependent utilities, pipelines and service companies. However, their investments have lost roughly $123 billion or nearly 20% in value, despite bullish equity markets during much of that period. That contrasts with activity in clean energy.

This is based on the axiom of Clausewitz, that the enemy’s effort will be proportionate to the sacrifice we demand from them.

This was discovered by mathematician Kurt Gödel, and Hilbert and the formalists were about to discover this too. However, the dream of a formal system of proof was already crumbling by the time Hilbert gave this speech. The video goes on to discuss Turing's theory of computing, and how his ideas about computability came from thinking about Hilbert's question: is math decidable? There is a hole at the bottom of math, a hole that means we will never know everything with certainty. However, thinking about this problem transformed the world of mathematics, and led to the development of modern computers.",Can't tell

In 2020, it was not particularly necessary to do QE in the amount of $7 trillion. It was too excessive!   QE is done for two reasons, to encourage banks to lend by giving them easing money and lowering government borrowing costs, which allows governments to have fiscal breathing room to pass their big stimulus packages.   In 2020, when you locked at bank reserves, it was quite clear that banks didn't need new money injected into them. They already had large bank reserves.

However, Central Asia is important to the U.S. in its own right. For one thing, it is composed of frontier markets that can be attractive to U.S. companies, apart from the energy firms that already operate there. And some governments share the Biden administration’s interest in environmental protection. Moreover, some Central Asian countries, like Kazakhstan, have a strong interest in taking bilateral ties with the United States to a new level.

As a result, qualitative surveys, like Net Promoter Score, end up missing critically important feedback.

Specifically, there are six benefits for adopting AI to analyze this feedback: It can 1) show you what you’re missing in your qualitative surveys, 2) help train your employees based on what’s actually important to customers, 3) determine root causes of problems, 4) capture customers’ responses in real time, 5) spot and prevent declines in sales, and 6) prioritize actions to improve customer experience...",No

"Mar 21, 2021 - Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil exporter, is no longer the world’s most profitable company.

This included thousands of nervous system disorders and a range of different autoimmune conditions and other ailments such as epilepsy, heart failure and strokes. Over 1,200 reactions were fatal, the data suggested.

I wouldn't do this, but it's interesting, because while In-N-Out seems super organized and on-the-ball in all things, shakes are one exception. Every time I order a shake it seems like it falls through the cracks. They call my number, I go up to get my food, and then usually I have to say something like ""my shake?"" and they'll go get it.    It's not like shakes needs to be served piping hot or something. In fact, usually the shakes are too thick to drink right at first anyway, so it would be nice if they poured them at the same time as the rest of the order, giving them a little time to melt.    Again, this ""tip"" is illegal AND unethical, and no one wants to take advantage of our favorite fast food joint, so don't do it.

While happiness is generally considered a desirable state, an unrestrained pursuit of perpetual elation might inadvertently diminish the depth of human experience.

"The UK-based JET laboratory has smashed its own world record for the amount of energy it can extract by squeezing together two forms of hydrogen. If nuclear fusion can be successfully recreated on Earth it holds out the potential of virtually unlimited supplies of low-carbon, low-radiation energy.

It's not a massive energy output - only enough to boil about 60 kettles' worth of water.

"This short piece explains the advanced state of decay that the Russian military-industrial complex finds itself in, and how the Russian government prefers to show “cartoons” and talk about “hypersonic” weapons, while turning a blind eye to the reality that Russia’s own industrial base is not capable of producing these, or even more fundamental, military materiel.   The author explains that this state of affairs should not reassure us. Because the only sector in which the Russian military has achieved marked successes in modernization relates to nuclear weapons, Moscow may feel compelled to “go nuclear” if it becomes involved in a conflict that it does not see any other way out of. Thus, the inherent problems in Russia’s defense industry—which at first may appear to be a constraint—could in fact end up making the world a more dangerous place.",Yes

From the story: The growing toll is evidence that the flood of fentanyl devastating communities across the Midwest and Northeast is spilling into Texas. More than 93,000 people died from drug overdoses across the U.S. in 2020, more than twice as many deaths as caused by motor vehicle accidents. About two-thirds involved opioids, and fentanyl is fueling many of them, experts say. The National Institute on Drug Abuse released data showing a 14-fold increase in synthetic opioids — mainly fentanyl — as the main driver of overdoses from 2012 to 2019.

This is due to a massive propaganda campaign waged by Robert Clive of India after his victory in 1757.   In reality, the British victory of 1757 was minor, in which they only defeated the Nawab of Bengal. Up until 1757, they did not have Naval supremacy on the West Coast either, losing constantly to the Maratha Navy. But nothing demonstrates better the fact that the British were the whipping boys of Indian Empires for 200 years before they conquered India (in 1818) than the Siege of Bombay.   The British, wanting to trade on better terms with the Mughals, launched a campaign of raids and attacks on the economic pulse of the Mughals. The British had made a miscalculation however.   In total, the British had 3,300 soldiers in India. The Mughals had 900,000.   More in more detail (with sources)  here",No

This is important for food security. China is set to get 25-years exclusive rights to purchase potash from this project which is due to start production in 2022.   What is interesting geopolitically is currently the trade route for potash needs to go through Lithuania port. With recent migrant crisis between Belarus and Lithuania, and spat between China and Lithuania on Taiwan, Belarus may be forced to reroute the shipment to Russia like they are doing with oil export. But an infrastructure upgrade is needed for that to happen. Belarus also recently signed a pact with Russia for closer economic integration.",No

"Ask yourself why are western leaders bankrupting their countries? Why are they pushing issues that divide us? Why are they making decisions that weaken the defensive capabilities of their own nations? Are they ALL really this incompetent, or is there a simpler and more logical conclusion?

And those sanctions... Are they not actually backfiring and harming America financially? We can see the global power shifting from the West to the East, and that is exactly what these leaders want.

"Video)  Account : Team Smooth (1000+ subs)    Making this video is one of the hardest things I've had to do. In it i don't give any personal reference but try to focus and zero in on only what may be salvageable meaning the people/males who are still alive. Suicide is not okay, worse of the fact that 80% of suicides are male suicides. Sometimes governments will not intervene with educational programs because this may contradict certain ""population reduction"" plans that governments have to better their GDP/National Budget.   It is sad that this statistic is looked at as a figure but not real actual people dying when they could have been saved.   It hurts to speak openly on suicide considering the agonising manner in which my uncle took his life. He suffered multiple organ failure and died a slow excruciating death. This inspired me to make the type of video I would have wanted him to watch before he considered suicide. Hopefully this helps those whom are still alive.",Yes

"To me, this exemplifies collapse.  People like Carter recognized the need for renewable energy sources in 1979 and made readily achievable goals for limiting our use of fossil fuels.  Yet, fourty years later, we haven't met his vision.  Just as Reagan quietly moved to take down the (largely symbolic) panels for his fossil fuel company sponsors in 1986, politicians today refuse to move forward on stopping climate change due to the sizable monetary interest in not doing so.   Carter suggested that Americans derive 20% of our energy from renewable energy sources by the year 2000.  In 2010, only 7% of our energy came from renewable sources.   In 2019, renewable energy only accounted for 11% of our total energy consumption.   This is unsustainable, and we need to move quickly to ensure that our planet is habitable in the future.",No

Employing QE during the 2008 financial crisis made sense, since banks were in a crisis and needed cash due to the massive amounts of bad debt they had on their books.   In 2020, it was not particularly necessary to do QE in the amount of $7 trillion. It was too excessive!   QE is done for two reasons, to encourage banks to lend by giving them easing money and lowering government borrowing costs, which allows governments to have fiscal breathing room to pass their big stimulus packages.   In 2020, when you locked at bank reserves, it was quite clear that banks didn't need new money injected into them. They already had large bank reserves.

The balloon falls back down to earth with carbon dioxide stored inside it for it to be sold for industrial use or pumped into the ground to be disposed of safely. The company believes the technology is scalable and could massively reduce carbon capture costs, aiming for it to cost $100 to $250 per tonne of carbon captured, and eventually $40 to $50.   “The company has tested its system on a small scale, Mansdorf says, releasing gas-filled balloons with a box that serves as a carbon-capture device attached underneath.   The frozen carbon is then separated from the air to be brought back to earth and can be recycled.

The IJA’s history is one in which modernity clashes with tradition and inter-service rivalry dominated the Japanese military establishment. Reformers and conservatives butted heads over whether Japan would adopt French methods of war or Prussian, smaller and more mobile divisions or larger ones encouraged by high morale and esprit de corps. This would continue for much of the IJA’s history.   One of Japan’s key weaknesses was lack of unity among its armed services. The army and navy formulated different national strategies and both had different sets of priorities. Another weakness Japan possessed was its poor logistical support. This was an issue that plagued Japan all the way back to the 19th century.",No

"For more than 15 years, cameraman and ecologist John D. Liu has been working on his worldwide mission to green deserts and to restore biodiversity.  It all started in 1995 when Liu filmed the Loess-plateau in China.

From that moment on, Liu has been travelling all over the world to convince and inspire government leaders, policy-makers and farmers with his film material and knowledge.    Liu diligently spreads the message that restoration of ecosystems is not only possible, but also economically very meaningful.

"Animalism in philosophy posits that humans are fundamentally animals. The view poses a threat to our beliefs about the special status of humans and life after death, as well as transhumanist ideals of consciousness transfers, human enhancement, or brain transplants. The primary argument against animalism is that possessing specific properties that animals lack means humans are not animals. But that is not the case, argues Eric T. Olson. Our capacity for thought and consciousness, often seen as proof of our human exceptionalism, is in perfect alignment with the abilities of animals and not unique to humans.

The Labor Department said Thursday that the number of claims increased from 658,000 the week before. Though the pace of applications has dropped sharply since early this year, they remain high by historical standards: Before the pandemic flattened the economy a year ago, jobless claims typically ran below 220,000 a week. Still, the four-week average of claims, which smooths out week-to-week gyrations, fell by 10,500 to 719,000 — the fewest since mid-March 2020, just before the pandemic began to cause widespread layoffs.

"It is well known that the earth is was past over due for several catastrophoc events. Massive flooding, earthquakes, hurricanes and Meter/space related impact. They are gearing you up to say it's Cliamte Change due to humans, it isn't.   Here's a few that are overdue:   -The Pacific NW is past due for massive flooding and earthquakes.   That cheerful orange stripe is known as the Cascadia Subduction zone. It's a fault line, where one part of the Earth enters the other. Most of the time, this happens smoothly, as if Barry White were playing in the background. But every once in a while, our douche of a planet likes to get rough and America rejects the incoming plate. This is called a full-margin rupture, and it's as devastating as it sounds. The last time that happened was in 1700, and the earthquake was so big that it caused a giant tsunami that destroyed a bunch of coastal Japan across the ocean. The Pacific Northwest is all but due for one of these, and it couldn't be more terrifying. When the next one happens, at roughly around a 9.0 (re: very bad) on the Richter scale, cities like Vancouver, Seattle, and Portland are in for what's been described as the worst natural disaster in the history of North America. FEMA projects 13,000 dying, one million homeless, and 2.5 million needing food. Or roughly five to six Katrinas. And that's not even counting Canada.   -San Francisco's Hayward Fault Gets An Earthquake Every 140 Years ... And It's Been 148 Since The Last One   -Places like Mumbai Are Going to Flood At Any Moment ...And are way past due   In a few decades, 11 million people will be at risk for these floods -- or $1.5 trillion, in heartless capitalist terms. And it's not just Mumbai, either -- cities like Chennai are going to have major floods in the next several years, too.   -The New Madrid Fault May Take Out 150 Miles Of The Midwest   Way back in 1811 and 1812, when America was still experiencing odd growth spurts and constantly arguing with its mother, a series of over 1,000 earthquakes rocked the Mississippi River between St. Louis and Memphis. One was so powerful that it caused the river to run backwards for a few hours. Another was felt all the way on the East Coast. The epicenter of the quakes was the town of New Madrid, which might as well have been renamed New New Madrid, because it took years to rebuild it.   Today, the affected cities sit peacefully on the mighty Mississippi -- despite that pesky 40 percent chance that a New-Madrid-level quake could hit in the next few decades.     Earth is due for an “extinction-level” event from the sky     ..and even if we see it coming, we won’t be able to do anything about it, a NASA scientist said Monday.   Speaking at a meeting in San Francisco, Dr. Joseph Nuth of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center said large asteroids and comets, the type that could wipe out civilization, are extremely rare, but tend to hit “50 to 60 million years apart.” Given that a comet wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, one could argue that we’re slightly past “due.”   “The biggest problem, basically, is there’s not a hell of a lot we can do about it at the moment,” he added.     We are overdue for a massive Tsunami/Earth quake  to strike the US     A natural disaster of titanic proportions is overdue to strike the U.S., physicist Michio Kaku warns.   Seismologists predict it will be the worst natural disaster in North American history, and the federal government estimates it could contribute to 13,000 deaths and 27,000 injuries.   ""It's not a question of if, it's a question of when,"" the City University of New York physics professor said Thursday on ""CBS This Morning.""     New York, which is actually riddled with faults, has a long history of earthquakes: On average, the region has witnessed a moderate quake (about a 5.0 on the Richter scale) every hundred years.

"Apr 9, 2021 - ABSTRACT: Virus propagation methods generally use transformed cell lines to grow viruses from clinical specimens, which may force viruses to rapidly adapt to cell culture conditions, a process facilitated by high viral mutation rates. Upon propagation in VeroE6 cells, SARS-CoV-2 may mutate or delete the multibasic cleavage site (MBCS) in the spike protein. Previously, we showed that the MBCS facilitates serine protease-mediated entry into human airway cells (Mykytyn et al., 2021). Here, we report that propagating SARS-CoV-2 on the human airway cell line Calu-3 - that expresses serine proteases - prevents cell culture adaptations in the MBCS and directly adjacent to the MBCS (S686G). Similar results were obtained using a human airway organoid-based culture system for SARS-CoV-2 propagation. Thus, in-depth knowledge on the biology of a virus can be used to establish methods to prevent cell culture adaptation...",No

Essentially, Russia pays no political price for nuclear saber-rattling and therefore find it a cheap way of driving up the political costs for western nations to remain engaged in Ukraine. Raising the specter of nuclear war provides ammunition for isolationist forces in Western politics to press for the abandonment of Ukraine. Because of the economic imbalance between Russia and the West, Russia's hopes for victory in Ukraine are based on a strategy of engineering Western disengagement from the conflict.
